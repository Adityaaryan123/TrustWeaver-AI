I know it's probably cheaper for the company, but I'd prefer to pay more and have a formulation closer to breast milk.

I enjoy her stand-up performances on the Comedy Central Roasts and her new TV series 'Another Period'. Unfortunately, I think all of her best material has already been written. I noticed that some of the jokes from Another Period are straight from Coke Money. Similarly, this album disappointed me because a lot of the jokes are either re-treads or the exact same jokes from Coke Money. Don't get me wrong; Coke Money is a great album that any comedy fan should have in their collection but my favorite comedians are the ones that keep writing fresh material, such as Maria Bamford, Patton Oswalt, Todd Barry, etc.  If you already own Coke Money, I wouldn't bother buying this unless you're a hard-core fan.

I first heard this folk song done by the Chad Mitchell Trio back in the early sixties.  Unfortunately, The CMT never included this track on many of their albums, only one of them to my knowledge, and their music hasn't been transferred to digital to any degree, either.  So it was with difficulty that I was finally able to track this song down in digital format.  With a bit of searching, it IS possible to locate this, and it has been done by a number of artists, but unfortunately, most of these artists never had very sophisticated audio engineering devoted to their recordings and the sound quality is not very good.  The ONE exception is this rendition by Paul Austin Kelly.  I had never heard of Kelly before and it seems that he has never been very prolific.  This is a shame because he has a wonderful voice and he has done a very, very good version of &#34;Ain't No More Cane On The Brazos&#34;.  I'm also glad that this is a studio recording without the collateral noise pollution from an audience.  Although it isn't exactly the CMT version for which I had been originally searching, it is every bit as good and very close to the same melody that CMT used.  I'm very happy with it. Curiously, and this is in no way any reflection on this recording, but I noticed that under, &#34;Genre&#34;, it is listed as, &#34;Childrens….&#34;.  This strikes me as bizarre.  It's clearly a Folk song with origins on the Southern prison chain gangs.  It's about serving HARD prison time.  It's about people being worked near to death and dying from neglect and brutal punishment while working on prison chain gangs on the sugar plantations along the Brazos River in Texas during the turn of the last century…..hardly subject matter for the genre of &#34;Childrens&#34; songs!",31-08-2015,1

I love the look and feel of it, and I get complimented on it all the time. If that were the entirety of the story, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most important part of this watch, the functionality, has some issues. Despite this being an automatic winding watch, it doesn't always stay wound. I have had days where I had to re-wind it before the end of the day. Most days however, it does last through the day. I just have to wind it and set the time again in the morning. Other mechanical self winding watches I own will in fact not need to be wound again until I stop wearing them for a full day. In addition, I can't always get the spring fully wound before it will start clicking and the spring skips off the winding gear.<br /><br />If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have returned this watch. Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window. So now I'm stuck with an only mostly working but beautiful watch. I guess that makes it kinda like a fashion model. When I think of it that way, it's not quite so disappointing.",31-08-2015,1

It looks elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 7.5\\"" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8\\"".<br /><br />The face of the watch is 1 3/16\\"" wide and the watch is 1/4\\"" thick. The back of the watch states it has Japanese quartz movement.  The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so it is a somewhat confusing as it refers to self-winding watches as well as quartz watches like this one.  The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.  It comes in attractive package, the box has a pillow and include a gift bag.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI for review.  Getting a review product does not influence what I say, I leave critical reviews as well as positive reviews like this one.<br /><br />Ali Julia review",31-08-2015,1

Things get complicated when her family moves to San Francisco due to a new job that Riley's dad got. As a result, Riley's emotions: Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, and Fear are all over the place due to this new change in Riley's life. It's up to Riley's emotions to help her go through all of this. Inside Out is easily one of Disney's best movies in recent years and is one of the best movies of this year. Inside Out was funny, incredibly relatable, realistic, and dare I say it: Emotional. Inside Out was so dramatic and emotional, it got to a point where I was tearing up quite a bit. Every scene got me invested in what was happening and what was going to happen. In the end, Inside Out was one of the best movies I have ever seen from Disney and in my whole life. If you haven't seen Inside Out, you are missing out on a modern Masterpiece!!!!!",31-08-2015,1

We did not study the story, we did not discuss the plot, the intertwined threads, the irony of the revealed identities of the various heroes and villains, the magnificence of the ending, the voyage of the characters.  No, my class was encouraged to find deep meaning in descriptions of mantelpiece decorations, in puns.  It was a colossal waste of time, and that method came close to spoiling a lot of splendid classics for me.<br /><br />When the school year was over, my younger self was sitting in front of the TV, aimlessly looking for something to watch. The movie for that night was A TALE OF TWO CITIES with Dorothy Tutin and Dirk Bogarde.  There being little else to watch, and feeling a niggling curiosity to find out what the book really WAS about, I sat back and watched.  The movie did a fairly good job following the book.  In an hour-plus movie based on a multi-hundred page book, things have to be cut out, but they did a good job.  The actors performed their parts very well, and there were some familiar character actors in there.  It brought the book to life, and got me reading Dickens again.<br /><br />I like Dirk Bogarde's interpretation of Sidney Carton.  He achieves shrewdness, suprising sentiment and intelligence.  His depiction of the change Carton goes through in the course of the book is very well done.  I have watched other versions of A Tale of Two Cities, but this remains my favorite, even as I acknowledge that Ronald Colman appears to be considered the best at the part.  For me, Bogarde captures the cynicism that hides his heart.<br /><br />From a quality standpoint., this DVD functioned very well (I watched it on my laptop), with good sound and a good picture.",31-08-2015,1

Just to make it interesting, the IMF is on the run from the CIA, and has to work with a rogue British agent whose loyalties are questionable.  Come along for the ride.  There's plenty of exciting scenes and suspense, even if you think you know the Mission Impossible formula cold...<br /><br />The  movie's opening scene reintroduces the returning characters, with Tom Cruise as Agent Ethan Hunt, Jeremy Renner as Brandt, Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, and Simon Pegg as computer expert Benjy Dunn.  Adam Baldwin joins the cast as the head of the CIA, out to eliminate the IMF.  Rebecca Ferguson is superb as Ilsa Faust, who may be a double or maybe even a triple agent.<br /><br />The story properly gets underway as Hunt is kidnapped from a secure site in London by the Syndicate.  There are terrific action sequences in Vienna at the Opera House; and in Morocco, at a secure facility inconveniently located under a water plant.  That set piece is followed by an even better motorcycle chase.  The climax is set in London, with a classic Mission Impossible ending.  There is much life in the franchise.

It's not perfect but worthy of the series.,"I really liked this film.  It is not as strong as the first in the series, but a definite improvement over the second film.  However, I am disappointed there was no marijuana montage like in the prior two films.<br /><br />Harold/John Cho is very successful, staid, and married, and he is no longer friends with Kumar/Kal Penn, who flunked out of medical school because of a positive urine test.  Vanessa/Danneel Harris makes a minimal appearance, and though she was a bright presence in the second film, her scene lacked spark.  I love Harold and Maria/Paula Garcés together; they have a naturalness smoother than chemistry.<br /><br />The star is definitely Neil Patrick Harris, who continues his hilarious turn as a warped version of himself.  His scenes were audacious, clearly he was given the best lines, and he was a magnetic, very charming presence.<br /><br />I wish there was more of Andy/Eddie Kaye Thomas and Seth/David Krumholtz.<br /><br />But a decent film overall.",31-08-2015,1

I love the demo feature - my son wanted to see the transition and he watched it several times while I explained what was happening and when he could get up. The eyes are designed well: my son tried to pry them open and they just gently shut again. They seem to have had that in mind when designing the clock, because it doesn't feel like prying the eyes open or shut will cause the mechanism to break. The power cord is pretty short but it is important that it at least has one, and an extension cord easily remedies the length. It's easy enough to set the controls, but I did need a few minutes of undistracted time to read them and figure it out. Don't expect to pull it out of the box and set it to work without some focus time first. One other thing that would be nice - the sheep's eyes are hard to see in the dark, so when it's still dark in the morning my son can't tell if the eyes are open. However, he understood to stay in bed when it was green, then he got up to check the eyes when the color went to white.

First, you can use the legs to raise it up, or you can remove the legs and sit it on the floor in front of your child. This is what we have done so far as our 7 month old can sit up very well on his own, but can't stand yet. He loves it. It feels like there are a million different things that each button does, and on top of that there are 3 different modes. One for english, one for spanish and one for french. There are a lot of lights, and music options.  Things that could have been better: -Volume. Even on the highest setting it still seems too quiet, but we also usually have someone watching TV and two other people hardcore PC gaming in our house, so the noise level is a bit higher than usual. -Legs Unless I'm doing something very wrong, they are flimsy cheap plastic inserts that don't seem to lock in at all. The table just kind of sits precariously on them. -Lights Oh lord, I'm always dismayed at these baby toys where the lights are dull and look like the bulbs burnt out before you bought them. Not this one! Your baby will be blinded by the lights instantly, lol. When I saw the keyboard lights I was like jesus I need to wear sunglasses for this. I handed it to my son to let him mash some buttons, and I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the way he jumped back in shock as his eyes were assaulted by the extremely bright LED's.

I like that it counts all of my steps during my day, including my rides, which has been super helpful.  The only issues I have found with my Fitbit so far is minor troubles with syncing it to my computer and phone. I just have to reset the Fitbit and it syncs right back into the system!

Granted, my needs are pretty simple (single member LLC with one employee), but every piece of functionality I use - basic invoice entry, sales receipt, P&L and balance sheet reports - is exactly the same.<br />If you do not need to upgrade due to the licensing rollover, I would recommend you save your money until you absolutely, positively, have to get the software.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are a small business owner looking for a good accounting package, I would strongly recommend this one - the core functionality is easy to use once you get it setup (and proper setup does take some time).",31-08-2015,1

Acrobat DC is so slow, it's unholy.<br /><br />I've been happily using Acrobat 9 (yeah, it's been a while...) for a long time now, but was happy to bring my version in to this decade.<br /><br />Out of the box, I was irritated that Adobe made me create an account. I was hopeful that the presence of physical media would mean that I could just install this and be left alone. Not so. Adobe wants you to make an account, but then they want separate activation. Acrobat also seems to phone home a lot, for no obvious reason. Call me paranoid, but Adobe's track record is not awesome when it comes to security, so I err to paranoia.<br /><br />Once installed, Acrobat really helped me to get my butt in gear and figure out where the &#34;Turn off notifications for this app&#34; function was in Windows 10, as it caused the system to chime with a message in the bottom right corner every time the update it was downloading was an extra percent complete.<br /><br />By the time it was installed and updated, I was really shocked by how painfully slow it is, relative to so many other PDF apps out there now. I'd understand if I was using something low-end from years ago, but my reference machine is a ThinkPad W541 with a Core i7 4910MQ, 32 gigs physical RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. Yet, it plods along.<br /><br />Really, the only thing Acrobat DC seems to be good at, is editing native PDF files. It does that really, really well -- albeit, really, really slowly. If you're spending most of your time editing someone else's PDF's (go ahead, I won't judge you), Acrobat DC is surprisingly good. Otherwise, I can't think of any reason to buy this.",31-08-2015,1

No disrespect meant here - I love and respect all animals, pigs included.I don’t pass judgement harshly, but I feel this motto's meaning applies to digital art programs in general and to Corel Painter in particular.<br /><br />I've dabbled in drawing and painting for several years, and although I'm not particularly capable at either, I do know my way around pencils and brushes. Having read many glowing reviews that followed every release of Painter since before it was even a Corel app, I finally decided to try the app myself.<br /><br />I realized something was wrong right from the start when I tried drawing an even tone using Painter's pencils - I've done this so many times on paper that I could probably do it in my sleep! In Painter, though, all I could manage was a bunch of lines and marks that would get darker and darker and never really blend.<br /><br />I was certain I wouldn't have a problem with Painter’s paint. I chose a grainy oil brush, picked a color, and started painting. Once again, I realized something wasn't right. With real media, I'd add paint to my brush only when I needed/wanted to. Painter's paint, however, would pile up with every new brush stroke. I figured I must have missed a setting that would make the brushes function more naturally. It turns out I was wrong - that's just how Painter works, and it can't be changed.<br /><br />I simply couldn't believe nor accept that Painter couldn't perform these two incredibly basic and essential tasks. Convinced I was doing something wrong, I scoured YouTube and user forums, and even emailed a few very helpful Painter experts. Incredibly, it turns out I was right all along - Painter, and most likely any other digital art app, simply can't emulate either of these tasks.<br /><br />So, back to piggy's lipstick...In my opinion, at least, all of Painter's fancy tools and effects are useless to me if I can't draw or paint naturally with them- it's like racing a car in a video game without steering or braking. Not much fun or use in either!",31-08-2015,1

Furthermore gHacks notes that ” these updates ignore existing user preferences stored in Windows 7 and Windows 8 (including any edits made to the Hosts file) and immediately starts exchanging user data with vortex-win.data.microsoft.com and settings-win.data.microsoft.com.<br /><br />Look it up, wake up.  Don't let Microsoft rape it's customers like this, maybe windows 10/8 can be saved if enough people reject this disgusting garbage, if not let Microsoft's Google style data rape attempt die with their terrible products.  Windows is not facebook or google + don't sit there and let them make it into one.  They ruined Windows 10 and now they wont be satisfied until they ruin Windows 7/8.1 too with the same anti privcy, anti consumer data mining garbage spyware.  Reject this crap or abandon windows for a more respectable/professional OS that actually recpects users rights/privacy.",31-08-2015,0

It looks a bit like Pinterest with photos and articles to choose from, making that part of this software even more user-friendly than the rest of it.<br /><br />The Organizer is not my favorite part of the software, but only because I still struggle to use it effectively. There are tutorials at Adobe and on YouTube though, and I keep watching them!<br /><br />There are more artistic touches in 13 than in 12, and while many of the upgrades are subtle, I feel like the upgrade was worth it for the forty-five I paid for it. Certain features do tax your system a bit, so if you're using a PC with minimal RAM you may want to consider upgrading your PC's memory prior to using this, or any other photo editing software.<br /><br />I'm using this product on a Mac Mini running Yosemite (16GB memory) and a Windows 7 64-bit (16GB memory) PC. I've found it to be stable on both platforms, but I did run into an issue installing it on the Windows 7 PC - it stalled at 1% and I had to restart the PC and retry it to make it work. Since that time the software has been OK though, running without crashing or freezing. Two activations come with the product, and you can work with RAW files if desired.<br /><br />Overall, a very good product which can be used by beginners to experts. Guided and Expert modes, lots of 'Help' and fun features make learning this software less daunting than the full featured and much more expensive full Photoshop and Lightroom products, yet still provides a lot of room to grow.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/11/15<br /><br />I've enjoyed using this product, but found on my Windows 7 PC whether it was a fresh 13 install or an upgrade to 13.1, I'm missing 8 Facebook Cover themes. I've posted on the Adobe forum in an attempt to gain resolution of this issue, but thus far - that feature is a bust!<br /><br />On the 'upside', the edited photos I've produced have been great and the software is stable.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/18/15<br /><br />The Facebook Cover themes have finally shown up and are working as expected.

An easy and interesting read. I bought the movie to add to my special VHS collection I keep. I only saw the movie once before and didn't like it at all, mostly because I honestly can't stand Rose McGowen. I thought maybe I was mistaken..this time around no, I still can't stand her. LOL  Her character sounds exactly as she did in Scream (like OMG-ish) She plays Lisa, the younger sister of Dr. Jennifer..who lives in Snowfield. Lisa is going to stay with Jennifer awhile. When they get to town..they find the maid dead, and everyone in town missing or dead...so the sheriff who is played by Ben Afleck and his crew show up. The best character to me is Deputy Stu Wargle..who is played by Liev Schreiber. If you know Lievs laugh and roles..you'll know what I mean. He makes me giggle every time he laughs. He fits this character well, imo. Anyway, the movie is OK. I got it fast and in good condition, so good seller.

The story captivated me, but I was also haunted by the music in the soundtrack, which remained in my head for a full 29 years until I finally had the opportunity to see the series again. The composer of this fine score, Michael Small, is inexplicably not included in the film credits or on the packaging for the tape, nor does the Main Theme appear to be available independently from any online source that I can uncover (I'd be grateful if someone can point me to such a source).<br /><br />The story is built around a mystery, but the real story is a classic one of heroism, integrity, courage, and race-relations; it remains relevant and inspiring in 21st-Century America, without being overly preachy. Highly-recommended viewing and, as at least one other reviewer has indicated, a nostalgic look back at a time when film studios took TV fiction series seriously enough to produce excellent drama.<br /><br />It would be generous to call the quality of the VHS recording &#34;fair,&#34; but as far as I can discover, there is no DVD or other media for this film, and for the quality of the original production, acting, and soundtrack, I give five stars. I hope that the series will be re-edited, restored, and re-released in the future.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the Kindle version of the book on which the mini-series was based, and which the series faithfully reproduces.",29-08-2015,1

The film opens with Zarkorr emerging from a California mountainside and frightening the locals. In a piece of editing that about breaks your neck, the action shifts to the Newark apartment of postal worker Tommy Ward (Rees Christian Pugh) who is greeted by a holographic &#34;teenage mall tramp&#34; materializing next to his cereal bowl, Proctor (Torie Lynch), who informs him that the monster is a test from an advanced civilization and that he is the sole human who can defeat him as they have identified him as the most average human on Earth. She warns him (while speaking directly to his cerebral cortex!) that Zarkorr is a 180-foot tall horned fire-breathing dinosaur who will home in on him, so he can't simply flee. While speaking in riddles she gives one key hint: &#34;Zarkorr contains the key to his own destruction&#34;.<br /><br />Tommy's initial instincts seem poor, as they involve a ridiculous kidnapping of a cryptozoologist, Stephanie (DePrise Grossman), although this does pay off in a hilarious three-way police standoff that firms up the storyline a bit. The protagonists flee to the lair of &#34;cybernaut&#34; Arthur, one of the most antisocial characters in memory (for a good guy), and lots of boredom ensues. Indeed, the biggest negative of the film is that there is precious little Zarkorr on display, and a lot of scenery-chewing distractions. I particularly commend the filmmakers for the bit of social commentary in which they have a pro-Zarkorr lawyer arguing that we can't harm him under the Endangered Species Act. Sadly, this bit of satire is even more relevant today than it was when this was made in 1996.<br /><br />If you do not wish to know the big secret Proctor alluded to in Tommy's Newark apartment, this would be a good time for you to stop reading this review: there's a costume change and a road trip to Arizona to find Zarkorr's off switch (I swear this is a plotpoint). There's intermittent lame city trampling, and the climactic scene in which Tommy must face Zarkorr one on one.<br /><br />Will Tommy save the world? Will he run for President? Will he ask Stephanie out? I won't answer those questions, but I will say that &#34;Zarkorr The Invader&#34; is an amusing parody of the famous Japanese kaiju movies that may have some tedious patches, but is an amusing and unusual departure from the normal Full Moon catalog.swear this is a plotpoint).

I only fill with water and immediately drain and air dry after every hike. I have experienced no altered taste or smells with this simple care. [Use your Nalgene for flavored water and alcohol!]<br />It's best to fill and pack first for ease in an overnight pack, but can still slide in with a full pack. I've had no issues with suction/water flow. Osprey changed the tube size to 1/4&#34;, which is a good thing as it it fits most quick change valves (mine is cut to allow for direct input from my water pump).<br /><br />The knock - the cap. You're going to have issues and it's only a question of when. The twist cap becomes stuck making it so you have to hold the blue plastic clip in order to securely twist the cap into place. I've found using olive oil (any vegetable oil will do)  on a Q-tip to lubricate the cap between the grey and blue part works well. Probably should avoid a synthetic lubricant like WD-40 unless you're feeling adventurous and are okay with your water smelling like your car's last oil change. This is where the old reservoir has it better - the cap on the old one is highly reliable.<br />Overall, it's good and would be 5-star with a better and more reliable cap (I'd prefer not having to take cautious lubricating measures every time I go on overnight trips).<br /><br />As with all resevoirs and water filtration devices, proper care is necessary. Take 3 minutes to pull it out of your pack immediately, drain, insert a paper towel, and then hang to dry. Unless of course you prefer that old musty scent. I do expect better though of Osprey with regard to the cap considering I'm not the only one who has to deal with this issue.",31-08-2015,1

I reviewed those also.  Save yourself money and hassle and buy these instead.<br /><br />These are amazingly great blades!  I feel like I should have paid more for them since they are so comfortable, smooth on the ground, and they don't have the crappy BOA lacing system that plagues many other K2 skates.  I guess time will tell how long these laces will hold up, but they are great so far.  The laces simply draw tight by pulling them up through the tongue.  They stay tight while skating.<br /><br />I was wanting to get a skate with 90+mm wheels (like my old K2s with the cruddy BOA lacing system) because the terrain I skate on is rocky and sandy.  I was pleasantly surprised and how when these glide over imperfect surfaces and resist rocks and debris.  I think that great shape of the skate and how well they fit your feet deserves the credit for the smooth operation.<br /><br />Ergonomically, these are far superior to the Roller Derby skates I returned and I think they are even better than my last 2 pairs of K2 skates simply because once the laces are tight, they are completely out of the way.  The toe box is well padded and a great shape for my average width feet.  The foot strap is effective and comfortable.  The ankle strap is also effective and comfortable.  When these are on your feet and laced up, you don't feel like you have a clunky contraction on your feet.  These feel like an extension of your foot.  You feel like a superhero with speed skate ability.<br /><br />I probably have 50-60 miles on them.<br /><br />Cheap at twice the price!",31-08-2015,1

This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big, not too small, but just right.  It is well-designed, with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag, I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black, but more like a charcoal color, if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle, but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw, but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook, you will need a bigger bag, but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book, this bag is AWESOME.

Let me tell you, I used ratcheting wrenches, deep-well sockets, flexible bit extension, 1/4&#34; and 1/2&#34; ratchets, and I'm about to use a angle grinder with a cutting wheel to cut down a &#34;too-long&#34; bolt. More about that one later.<br /><br />I understand that this is a universal (and relatively inexpensive) product which has to adapt to many different styles of bicycles while still remaining functional. Remarkably, I was able to install it onto my front fork suspension mountain bike successfully. Here are some of the issues I ran into: First, the instructions are HORRIBLE. The description is rather vague, but at least they could show a picture of the item installed correctly. Rather, they give you just the bare minimum to install the seat correctly. You really need to have your spatial analytic skills down to figure out the correct orientation for each mounting point. Second, if you have a rear derailleur, it will be tricky to mount the rear support tube if any wires run down near any of the mount points suggested in the install. Third, don't tighten down any bolts until you have most of the seat installed since you will be adjusting them constantly. Fourth, once you install the seat, take it for a test run because you'll see that you'll need to adjust it once again depending on your riding style. Fifth, the plastic doesn't like it too much if tighten any screws or bolts against it (as other commenters have noted). Lastly, perhaps its just me and my big fat leg, but there is one bolt near the seat post which despite any amount of adjustment, rubs the inside of my leg as I pedal. I'll be taking the angle grinder to that bolt and cutting off the excess.<br /><br />BUT... like I said, AFTER it's installed, I felt safe and comfortable riding with my child int it.",31-08-2015,1

The bike fit him perfectly with the seat post most of the way down, giving lots of room for growth.  We gave him this bike in March and I am not writing this review in August, so this review is with 5-6 months of experience with using the bike.<br /><br />The bike arrived in a relatively small box and assembly was done in 5-10 minutes.  Attached the handlebars and seat post, tighten with a provided allen wrench and done.  The bike is made of solid metal (steel maybe?), is very sturdy but not too heavy for even my toddler.  He is able to pick it up and maneuver it himself.  We have left the bike outside accidentally and the paint and bike is still like new.  A very sturdy bike, a great design and the concept of a balance bike was perfect for my son.  Once he warmed up to the idea of being on the bike, he walked while standing for the first month or so, has since learned to sit and walk and now if quickly catching onto the idea that he can control how fast he goes!!  Last month I raised the seat for the first time and he still has plenty of room to grow with this bike.  We will use this bike until he is ready to transition into a bike with pedals and no training wheels.  He'll be ready thanks to Strider!",31-08-2015,1

Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""Xquare 2\\"". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.

Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That's quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds, but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it's a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren't trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there's the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at, but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here, especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""reference\\"" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician, you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn't one, and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears, I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods, which \\""sit\\"" in my ears nicely, don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small.

I love the demo feature - my son wanted to see the transition and he watched it several times while I explained what was happening and when he could get up. The eyes are designed well: my son tried to pry them open and they just gently shut again. They seem to have had that in mind when designing the clock, because it doesn't feel like prying the eyes open or shut will cause the mechanism to break. The power cord is pretty short but it is important that it at least has one, and an extension cord easily remedies the length. It's easy enough to set the controls, but I did need a few minutes of undistracted time to read them and figure it out. Don't expect to pull it out of the box and set it to work without some focus time first. One other thing that would be nice - the sheep's eyes are hard to see in the dark, so when it's still dark in the morning my son can't tell if the eyes are open. However, he understood to stay in bed when it was green, then he got up to check the eyes when the color went to white.

Indeed, I do love the size and many, many things about the design. However, the strap clips have now broken TWICE, the brake no longer releases properly, and the front wheels stick/squeak. This is in less than two months of ownership. This stroller is going back, since it's still under Amazon's return period.<br /><br />I am very disappointed, as this is my third Baby Jogger stroller, and the quality has always been far better than this Zip's. Our original 2011 City Mini took a beating and we ran it into the ground over 4+ years. The Versa we bought last year has been great, it is like the Cadillac of strollers, but I got the Zip because the Versa is heavy and unwieldy when folding/unfolding. The Zip needs a version update, with assurance from Baby Jogger that the strap and brake issue will be fixed before I try it again.",31-08-2015,1

First, you can use the legs to raise it up, or you can remove the legs and sit it on the floor in front of your child. This is what we have done so far as our 7 month old can sit up very well on his own, but can't stand yet. He loves it. It feels like there are a million different things that each button does, and on top of that there are 3 different modes. One for english, one for spanish and one for french. There are a lot of lights, and music options.  Things that could have been better: -Volume. Even on the highest setting it still seems too quiet, but we also usually have someone watching TV and two other people hardcore PC gaming in our house, so the noise level is a bit higher than usual. -Legs Unless I'm doing something very wrong, they are flimsy cheap plastic inserts that don't seem to lock in at all. The table just kind of sits precariously on them. -Lights Oh lord, I'm always dismayed at these baby toys where the lights are dull and look like the bulbs burnt out before you bought them. Not this one! Your baby will be blinded by the lights instantly, lol. When I saw the keyboard lights I was like jesus I need to wear sunglasses for this. I handed it to my son to let him mash some buttons, and I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the way he jumped back in shock as his eyes were assaulted by the extremely bright LED's.  All in all, flimsly legs, bright lights, and volume aside, I would recommend this to everyone with a &#62;6month old.",31-08-2015,1

The Mamaway is thick fabric which makes me feel totally secure and able to be 100% hands free using it. I can tell my little girl is so happy being carried on my hip and able to see out rather than facing me. I can't wait to try out more holds with the ring sling!

With over 250,000 copies in print and a meteoric rise to No. 1 on Business Weeks's hardcover business books best-seller list, this revenge of the cubicle dwellers is a mix of cartoon strips and Scott Adams' succinct observations describing ridiculous company policies and dysfunctional management practices. Not surprisingly, the message is coming in loud and clear in high places. Reengineering guru Michael Hammer has jumped on the Dilbert bandwagon by suggesting that &quot;there is more truth in one volume of Dilbert than there is in 10 volumes of Harvard Business School case studies.&quot; Dilbert pokes fun at organizations where nothing ever really changes except the business buzzwords and corporate slogans. Perhaps that's the secret of the strip's success, both in the U.S. and abroad. &quot;Everybody thinks Dilbert is making fun of somebody else's situation,&quot; suggests Adams, an ex-Pacific Bell cubicle dweller for the past nine years until he was &quot;downsized&quot; recently when his department came under new management.

The subjects are the British Navy of the Napoleonic Wars and  two men: Aubrey -- a naval officer and (one quickly assumes)  one of the best sailors who has ever lived and Maturin -- a  physician and &quot;agent extraordinaire&quot; who seems to be  bent  on giving Thomas Jefferson a run for his money as  the man who knows the most of everything that could  be known.    O.K. so you don't like war, sailing, or the early 19th century.  After a few minutes reading this book, you will.

After this horrid crime is committed, Tonya's father, Carl Lee exacts vengeance on the two rednecks, and kills them. He is put on trial, and lawyer Jake Brigance is introduced to us. He takes Carl Lee's case and must face his hated enemy, Rufus Buckley, in court. The days leading to the trial are filled with KKK threats, riots between blacks and the KKK, and several other chills and spills.

Now, for what became of Blackthorne after Toranaga's victory at   Sekigahara... he acquired a large estate in Japan, and married a  Japanese woman. Adams never returned to England. He died in Japan,   laden with honors (presumably from Ieyasu), but still longing for  his homeland. There is a monument to Will Adams in Japan, near the sea.

US,53085754,RGESCSSCKWRY4,316920045,669738240,Infinite Jest: A Novel,Books,5,3,4,N,N,Feel your attention span stretch back out where it belongs.,"The Doorstop's Here   A hellaciously gifted young writer named David Foster Wallace has just written a   huge new novel called ``Infinite Jest,'' and somebody really ought to smack him with it.          It takes a special kind of nerve to write a book with roughly the mass of a medicine   ball, and then end it so unsatisfyingly that the poor reader perversely finds himself wishing   it longer. But Wallace's limp coda only disappoints because the preceding three-and-a-half   inches of ``Infinite Jest'' have succeeded so well at projecting a world of brain-scalding   complexity.     But when is Wallace carefully teasing out a recurrent motif, it's worth   wondering, and when is he just repeating himself? Literally from first page to last, though,   Wallace has given us a meditation on addiction -- the addiction of a tennis prodigy to   organic narcotics, of a paroled second-story man to inorganic ones, of the terrorist to his   cause, the couch potato to mindless pleasures, and ultimately, the unkickable addiction of   readers to all those old storytelling conventions Wallace gleefully blows up like a rotten kid   cherry-bombing an electric train.     The biggest addiction on display here may be Wallace's own, to writing, a habit so   consuming that the only way for him to shake it is with an abrupt, cold-turkey ending.   Luckily, savingly, ``Infinite Jest'' has a second serve to fall back on: its authentically   hysterical, drink-milk-at-your-peril humor.     Here's Wallace doing an overzealous high-school tennis announcer: ``Lamont Chu disembowelled Charles Pospisilova 6-3, 6-2; Peter Beak spread   Ville Dillard on a cracker like some sort of hors d'oeuvre and bit down 6-4, 7-6...while   Gretchen Holt made PW's Tammi Taylor-Bing sorry her parents were ever in the same   room together 6-0, 6-3...''     This is comic overkill of the wettest possible water, the sort of stuff good for   reading aloud to one's more indulgent friends -- ``Wait, just one more'' -- taking care to   leave out expressions like ``SACPOP'' that Wallace doesn't even see fit to explain until 100   pages later, in a slapstick set piece so funny you forgive him immediately. The passage is   also symptomatic of one of Wallace's bad habits, namely, too many characters too quickly   introduced and never adequately differentiated -- not a bad metaphor for the whole high   school experience, but also a hallmark of too many fat books one finds in used-book stores   with their first couple of chapters thoroughly begrimed and the rest in near-mint condition.     ``Infinite Jest'' should find a kinder posterity in just about any near future except the   one where it takes place, sometime early in the next century. Books don't count for much   in Wallace's dystopia, and the only one mentioned is a copy of William James' ``Varieties   of Religious Experience'' long since hollowed out as a stashbox.     Just how early in the next century this is can't be pinned down, as the Gregorian   calendar has long since made way for Subsidized Time, which takes the concept of   commercial sponsorship to its logical terminus by rechristening 2001 or 2020 A.D. or   whatever, as the Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken, the Year of the Depend Adult   Undergarment, &amp;c. Like much else in the book, this tactic is mysterious at first, a scream   when Wallace lets you in on the joke, and kind of a pain by the time he beats it into the   ground. Mercifully, he starts abbreviating the years after a while, then changes his mind   and goes right back to spelling them out.     Approriately for a book about addiction, ``Infinite Jest'' is told largely in flashbacks.   The novel begins with Hal Incandenza, its tennis prodigy antihero, suffering a mysterious   seizure during an Arizona college interview early in the Year of Glad, as in trashbags. We   then backpedal to the rigorously regimented Enfield Tennis Academy near Boston, Hal's   and our home off and on for the bulk of the book. E.T.A is the brainchild of Hal's late   father, J.O., a man of high and wide attainments, last but not least of them artfully cutting a   large hole into the door of a microwave oven, inserting his head, and letting it rip.     J.O.'s place on campus and in Hal's mother's bed has fallen to a shady relation,   giving rise to the suspicion, reinforced by the book's title, that what we've really signed on   for is some hypermodern pastiche of ``Hamlet.'' This holds water as far as it goes, viz.,   until Wallace starts cross-cutting between the Academy and its Enfield neighbor, a   dilapidated halfway house for dipso- and other maniacs. At this point, a fresh scenario   pokes its head out of the verbal thicket -- that ``Hamlet'' is just a red herring, and that   Wallace is really concocting a sort of elephantine variation on ``Entropy,'' Thomas   Pynchon's classic short story of contrasted chaos and regimentation.     Wallace's other novel, ``The Broom of the System,'' has already elicited cries of   ``Pynchonesque!'' from diverse quarters, some of them, to be sure, using the adjective in its   usual sense, i.e., as reviewer's code for ``I didn't finish it,'' others so besotted with Pynchon   that they see his scat everywhere, but a few finding genuine similarities. Both men do share   a head for science, a stomach for gross-out humor, a great ear, and a soft spot for the word   ``maffick,'' but Wallace definitely has the lower opinion of sloth.     This emerges from a third thread in ``Infinite Jest,'' one that pulls it beyond the   realm of homage to either Shakespeare or Pynchon. Hal's father, during his avant-garde   filmmaker phase, has somehow made a movie so enjoyable as to be 100% lethal. All   viewers unfortunate enough to catch even a snippet of this mortally popular production,   which ironically shares its title with the novel, at once live only to see it again and again,   lapsing into a persistent vegetative state from which only drool-drowning will ever deliver   them. All copies have now gone missing, and the post-NAFTA Organization of North   American Nations (O.N.A.N.) is ineptly racing to find them before they can fall into the   Wrong Hands, namely those of a splinter group of legless Quebecois separatists in   wheelchairs.     If this starts to sound a mite daffy, it's also deadly serious. Like ``1984'' and ``A   Clockwork Orange,'' both of which he unmistakably invokes, Wallace's critique of a future   society whose only grail has become the hangoverless bender, the infinite jest -- the   neverending Year of Glad -- rings so true and contemporary it's almost late.     In a way, of course, it is. Everybody from Neil Postman in ``Amusing Ourselves to   Death'' to 10,000 Maniacs in ``Candy Everybody Wants'' has tilled this ground before.   What keeps it fresh is Wallace's prose style, a compulsively footnoted amalgam of   stupendously high-toned vocabulary and giddy low-comedy diction, coupled to a sense of   syntax so elongated that he can seem to go for days without surfacing. At times he appears   determined to end each sentence with a preposition or not at all, with perhaps the slight   edge going to not at all. A Wallace sentence finally draws to a close amid reluctance and   relief, like a hitting streak. Half the time you'll want to pitch the damn book clear into the   next room, with or without benefit of doorway, but the other half you can actually feel   your attention span stretching back out to where it belongs.     Then, contrary to the occasional renegade suspicion, it ends. Little gets resolved,   least of all a reason for Hal's first-chapter seizure, although at least three good guesses   come to mind. Several well-developed characters and one improbably touching romance all   come to naught. Pynchonesque, some will say, but with Pynchon, he's playing with the   whole idea of narrative closure, not thumbing his nose at you for giving a damn.      Finishing ``Infinite Jest,'' one feels less played with thantoyed with. Still, better to   be toyed with by a genius than pandered to by some second-rater who'd write a few   hundred pages and give up. And Wallace has a toybox to do Pandora proud.",22-08-1996,1

You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br />As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br />Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br /><br />It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br /><br />The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br /><br />My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br /><br />I will continue to test and report any new developments.",31-08-2015,1

Upon opening the packaging it comes with a pack of paper, and a pain charging cable.  On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br /><br />I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br /><br />Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br /><br />My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br /><br />While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br /><br />When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br /><br />I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer / printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br /><br />I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br /><br />Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br /><br />As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br /><br />The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone / One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br /><br />I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br /><br />The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink/film/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />* Cool concept<br />* Makes stickers<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Fairly quick printing<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The quality of prints are low<br />* Android app needs work<br />* Very expensive per print<br />* Very small print size.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended.

Packed inside the box is the USB microscope, stand, USB cable, an installation software (CD) a manual, a quick start guide, and calibration chart.  However, if you do not have a CD&#60; you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.<br /><br />Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.  Instead, you view images on your computer.  Magnification, up to 330x, is controlled through the software.<br /><br />The general design of the microscope is good for the intended purpose.  The base is heavy enough and seems secure.  Enough control points are provided, allowing you to hold down slides.  Note-  I was provided a sample for a no obligation review.",31-08-2015,1

The camera itself is good, but I think the app is buggy.  It tends to just sit there and churn when I click on my camera to view it. There is a 2-3 sec delay on the video, which is okay, but sometimes the app freezes, so it doesn't show the correct picture.  However, you can turn the mic on and listen to what is happening?  But what good is that.  You have to manually turn of event recording while you are home, or else you get videos of you and your family doing your normal routines.  The free 1-day cloud storage is good, and most products don't have that.  Quality of the picture is very good whether day or night.  However, if you leave it on auto, it will probably be on night vision (black/white) when not home, as not enough lighting. I have to set it to off during the day, so I can see in color.  Alerts are very good, and spot on.  But I would only use that when away from your house, or else you will get a lot of phone alerts, unless you turn off event recording or the mobile alerts.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the phone app.  You can pan/tilt, but it's not a continuous movement, almost in frames, if that makes sense.  You can also manually set to record, but haven't checked to see how long it will run.  Overall good product, just wish they would fix the app issues, because those get frustrating.  Considering sending back and getting something else, but can't seem to find something better in the same price range with free cloud storage.  So really, really hoping they fix the app issues :)",31-08-2015,1

Worthless customer support,"I've had Webroot for a few years. It expired and I decided to purchase a renewal on Amazon. I went through hell trying to uninstall the expired version in order to install the new.  I called Webroot and had their representative remote into my computer at his request. He was clueless as a bad joke and consumed 29 minutes and 57 seconds of my time forever.  He initially told me it wasn't compatible with Windows 10, but I finally managed to convince him that it is indeed compatible with Windows 10 as it was working on my computer before it expired and also I showed him a review on Amazon to convince him that it works on Windows 10. Finally, he offered to connect me with a senior consultant for over 100 dollars. I declined and told him I'd fix the issue myself. This guy was less helpful than a severed limb.  After spending some time on Google, the issue is now fixed. Webroot should just get rid of their customer service and pay Google for indexing much more helpful info that their dedicated customer service can offer.  As far as the software itself. I think it scans fast, does not slow down my computer and I hope (like most other people including experts) that it's very effective in removing and preventing malware.  Years ago I did extensive research and found it to be among the best, but that was over 4 years ago. Things are fluid in the malware kingdom.  To those experiencing the same issue installing as I did - My advice - don't bother uninstalling the old version, rather launch webroot and click on  &#34;my account&#34; on the right side, then copy and past your product key in the area that says &#34;enter a new keycode&#34;, then click on Activate.

Once assembled, the pairing via bluetooth and use of the stick are easy and intuitive. Nothing to it.<br /><br />The stick comes with a USB charging cable but arrived with a charge so you can use it immediately, though it’s probably a good idea to charge it right away so that you have no interruption of use out of the box. Make sure the stick is switched to on (it will light up) and extend your stick to the length you desire up to about a yard’s length and snap away.<br /><br />The phone clamp held the phone sturdily so I wasn’t worried about it slipping out. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver.  But that will happen with any stick and is not specific to this one in particular.<br /><br />Two things that could improve this: 1) add the option to clamp this in portrait orientation instead of having to try and hold the stick at the portrait angle, which makes it feel unstable; 2) add the opening for a tripod so that this can be used to sit upright on a table for skyping and facetime eliminating the need to hold the phone up with your hand, causing fatigue.<br /><br />But other than that, this is a nice quality monopod for a variety of picture taking opportunities.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion.",31-08-2015,1

I LOVE these style of Bluetooth headsets. This one is slightly different from my very first pair I got over a year ago. They are the same shape but this one is not as finished as my current set.  The sound quality is not as clear as my QCY set but is pretty good. It has a nice balance of sound and the bass is sufficient. The sound quality is not like those expensive Beats or bose headphones, but it’s good enough for the price point. These go in the ear so it does block sound out. It blocks noise out so well that when I’m using these in the office, I can get more work done because I don’t hear the chatter of people around me.<br /><br />These use your standard micro usb cables so there’s no fear if you lose the cable that this set comes with. It charges up full in about an hour from dead and right out of the box it charged up in about 30 minutes. The battery life lasts me about 3 work days before needing to be recharged and that includes using it while on the way home from work which is a one hour minimum drive to and from the office.<br /><br />When using this for phone calls, you must leave the left ear piece hanging down around your neck. The microphone is on that earpiece. If you leave it in your ear, the person on the other end will not hear you clearly because the mic will be by your ear. The one thing this set is missing is a clip so you can clip that ear piece onto your collar for phone calls. If you’re like me and always moving around, if the earpieces shuffles around, the person on the phone can hear all the movement.<br /><br />Also, the volume button. It is very temperamental. When I try to hit volume up, I barely touch it and it adjusts volume. When I press down on it adjust volume it has a slow reaction. It’s almost like it works like a touch screen. Holding down the volume up and down buttons while listening to music will skip forward and back on your song list. With very minimal buttons, this is a very easy headset to use. It comes with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.s with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.",31-08-2015,1

Dropped this on cement, Hard Tile floor, on the sidewalk, and a few Other non carpeted areas. I don't know if it's the construction itself that makes it strong or maybe that LG Of Korea purposely made this phone very strong since it's marketed to teens and younger folks, or maybe it's because every time you dropped the phone instead of it's falling all in one piece and absorbing all the Impact, the back comes off and the battery comes out oftentimes but when you put it back together it works fine. I even had a few front facing dropS so many times I thought oh my God this is it my phone is shattered but I was wrong I am so confident in this phone that I Could do a ear height drop test anytime anywhere and I'm 100 percent sure it won't break and I'm 5ft 10. I don't even have a case on it it's just the screen protector and that's it.  Good Conversation starter (The Eyes)  you have no idea how many conversations have started Because of this.  Me: *Takes my phone out of my pocket to see notifications*  Her: &#34;Omg, does your phone have eyes? Thats sooo cute&#34;  Me:yeah, it's a lil phone from Korea. The Lg aka. check it out it's eye's move too. It even blinks too Her: Thats so adorable, Im ******* by the way.  Continue talking and i ended up getting so many kiks/phone number because of that but i digress. (It's Still Corvette over females doe) A great way to break the ice.  Audio  The Sounds sounds great coming through the speakers no cracking or nothing like that, it's not super loud but if you put it at full volume here and enjoy it even if you're a good distance away. earbuds, it works with every pair of earbuds I have very compatible. Crisp .plus with the LG software their version of the music app you have the option to increase t, the treble, all that. I love that features some songs just don't sound the same without all that bass.let's see what else can I say about the sound? the notifications can be nice and loud. And yeah if you're really into music this is a great phone.  Design   if you are coming from some other company and you're used to the buttons on the sideit'll take a little while but eventually you'll get used to the volume rockers and power button being on the back. and if you don't want to have to deal with that this phone has knock knock you tap on the screen twice to wake it up and then you can enter your password and all that instead of using the little button on the back. and most of the time you can use the littles options At top to adjust the volume but as I said before it's pretty easy To get used to. Plus the phone looks nice, its not ugly.  Call quality The call quality is decent. I thought since this phone was from overseas the call Quality might be off but now it's on point. Texting works normally too .  The speed  if you are used to be mid-range phones, this is quite a little Speedy One.   The Flex factor  lots of people buy Phones As fashion statement, the question is if my  put his galaxy/iPhone/Note/ on the table and you put yo phone next to theirs how would it stack up? I would give this phone a 7. Its pretty nice and if you keep it clean(its easy,every not and again wipe wit a lil rubbing alcohol) you can flex on anyone. Looks like one of them $700 Flagships. If yo guy friends see the eyes however they might clown ya. But that don't matter. The eyes are cool to me and that's all that matter.  Security Lots of options to keep it safe. Bunch of lock options and it has lookout too.at least mine did you might have to install it.  accessories  If you like customization this phone comes with funny lil stickers to put on it. If you older you might not care but i found this cool.  Weight  Its not heavy. I likes this.   OsThe operating system is Kitkat, I personally like KitKat. it gets the job done and it doesn't have too many features that I'll never use thatll just drain my battery.  Memory   16 gigs of internal space . And thats good considering my other phone before this had 8 . Up to 32 gb with a memory card but I used a 64 gb chip and it's worked fine.  Auto focus lazer  Cool feature on the camera very useful. And it can shoot high resolution video  Battery   lasts a while. I can get 6 hours wifi on heavy use but if the brightness is at 100 you lose some up time. And if yiu get a replacement battery you can just switch it out bam.  Cons  Camera isn't highest quality. Kinda grainy.  Not waterproof/Water resistant. Thats how my broke. Not broke but it's messed up pretty bad.   Price. Depending on what color you get this can go up to be 300 dollars, them Amazon vendors tryna rip y'all off this a $200/$250 Phone don't be rash wait till the price go down.  Front facing camera is not that great either but you can see so its not complete trash.  Too much stuff. Too many apps pulling on the ram makes it studder occasionally. Not bad but you'll notice it.   5 inches. I came from 4.7 in, i though well .3 in isn't that big of a jump but I was wrong, sometimes I have difficulty reaching the top of the screen to pull down my notification thing. Not the phone fault my hands just wasn't  for 5 in.   Micro sim. I had a regular sim. But its alright T-Mobile switch it and gave me a new one free.  I lied at the start.

The problem now seems to be fixed. About the camera itself...it's a really good little camera, the picture is really clear and the colors are very natural. This camera rivals many more expensive models. Take a look at the YouTube videos, they speak for themselves. The only problem I have (with any of these cameras) is, the setting buttons are really small, for a man's hands that can be a problem, but other than that I really don't have any other complaints with this camera. It does what it was designed to do. The company is really nice to deal with if you do have a problem, like with any electronic device, things can and do go wrong sometimes, but this company responds quickly to rectify a problem which keeps their costumers happy. Over all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this very reasonably priced camera to any one looking to purchase a car camera.

I have ear-bud phones which block noise and these block better with better sound and no more gooey-squishy-sweat in my ear canals.  I have paired it with 2 tablets (one android, one Windows) and my phone all easily.  Good sound quality. Does not block enough outside sound to serve as hearing protection, nor would I expect it to, but it is close and works well for my needs in a tractor which isn't very loud.<br /><br />Pros:  Good sound quality.  Voice notifications lets you know on/off/pairing.  Comfortable (fits fully over my ears).  Range; I tried pairing to my phone when outside ready to hit the tractor and it wouldn't do it....came to realize it was still connected inside to my tablet which I had to go inside to disconnect.  Nice compact case.<br />Cons:  At this price point I can't complain.  The USB charger cable is unique and may be difficult to replace (USB to mic jack). They feel &#34;flimsy&#34; but then that means they are lightweight and comfortable for work-use or long games.<br />Unknowns:  I haven't run the battery dead yet to know run time; at least a few hours.  Microphone; haven't tried it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  when these wear out I will get another pair.

You can place the phone on it lengthwise, or straight up and down without difficulty.  Once on, the phone doesn't move while I'm driving through any turns, stops, or bumps.

I love the extra piece of leather on the first two fingers and the thumb, which is where the others always wore out. There is a little extra padding on the palm and knuckles. The padding may make them a little warmer than typical light-duty gloves. The side of the forefinger is reinforced as well. The construction overall is very good.  The small size fits my hands (which are med/large women's size) well, although it is a tad bit bigger than my usual brand. I am very happy so far and will follow up in time when they are used more.

Yes.,"I don't have a lot of uses for a spindle sander, so I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money or to get a sander that couldn't be stored easily when not in use.  The WEN is perfect and pack a lot of power.  The WEN looks exactly like oscillating sanders offered for sale from other manufacturers, which I suspect means it's coming from the same factory in China that makes these for a different companies.  However, reading the specifications, this one reports to have a substantially more powerful motor than the others advertised at higher prices.  I can't speak to whether this is in fact true since I haven't purchased the others.  The WEN isn't that heavy, but the base is flat and didn't vibrate when placed on my workbench.  Clamped to the workbench it was virtually vibration free. I guess if you're doing really detailed work you might want something a lot heavier, but I suspect if that's the kind of work you need to do that you already know you're going to need a much more expensive sander than this one.<br /><br />Having built in storage is really nice, though I wish they had also thought to add a place to store the wrench that comes with it for removing the spindle nut.  It's also really helpful that supplies for this sander are easy to get - there is nothing proprietary about this sander.<br /><br />One thing I especially like is that the dust collector port is a standard one.  I've read reviews of some of the other versions of this sander that report unusually sized ports.  I tried out the sander with my shopvac attached was pleased with the results.",31-08-2015,1

Very powerful, just as a test I installed a 3.25&#34; raised panel profile bit, no problem with control and produced an smooth edge.

This thing is awesome we tested the range and got somewhere close to 50 yards without an issue. Getting the controls is a bit tricky at first but after about twenty minutes you get the feel for it. The drone comes just about fly ready you just have to sync the controller. I am definitely a fan of the drones now.

A nice variety of games with different skill levels. We learned very quickly that we needed an additional controller so that was purchased asap. The little ones loved showing off their counting talents but the older one grew bored with the play after his first turn. &#34;Too much like school Nana&#34;. I like that the 3 year olds will grow with the game. I would not recommend it for kids at the top of the age range though as it doesn't seem to hold their interest very long.<br /><br />A side note - After playing the game we had to break out the movie and watch for the umpteenth time but we are not complaining, we all love the movie.",31-08-2015,1

Mine LOVES it. Be prepared to want to shoot yourself in the head after playing it for the umpteenth time in a row, but fun enough to entertain a preschooler (though would get boring pretty fast for an older child). Gameplay is simple enough to allow for young kiddos to play independently of an adult (if that is an option for you!) For like the $5-6 I paid for it, the game is interchangeable for just cheap but pretty sturdy pirate toys (even recycle the sword into a safe, lightweight Halloween costume accessory), so worth the price on that note alone. On the one hand, I love that the map (which you can't really see in the picture) is also a bag to hold the game, but would've preferred that the game packaging was reusable as a box as the map gets &#34;deformed&#34; by stuffing all the pieces in it and becomes somewhat of a pain to use as the flat playing surface necessary for the game (especially if you are not interested in pulling the little plastic stands off the treasure pieces every time which I imagine would also decrease the life of the pieces). This is of course easily solved by say putting it all in a gallon or bigger sized ziplock, or another box you have around, especially if you'd like it to stack nicely with your other games, but since I had to chuck all the packaging, would have been less wasteful if it was reusable. Overall, a fun and inexpensive game for the younger set which can be made super simple or a bit more challenging depending on how serious you are about hiding the treasure, and fun game/pirate-play pieces (just don't lose them!).",31-08-2015,1

I've Been Using Mine For a Few Years Now.  First, I Paid a Few Dollars Less For Mine and The Price Has Jumped.  They're All Imported, so Try to Find Either a Cheaper One or One That's Extremely Well Made.  This One is Made Well Enough, If You're Careful.  This Thing Can Cut You, So Don't Let Some Kid Use It, &#34;Because It Looks Like Fun!!&#34;  You Need A Pineapple That's Big Enough.  I Can't Tell You How Many Times I Went to Wal-Mart or the Grocery Store and Their Pineapples were Just Too Small of a Diameter.  It HAS to Be Big Enough.  It's Better To Have Some Waste on The Inside Of The Husk.<br /><br />When I'm Finished Using The Pineapple Corer, Then I Cut Up the Husk Of The Pineapple To Get The Rest Of The Pineapple Cut Up and I Save The Core of the Pineapple To Go Into My Iced Tea Pitcher or Drink Pitcher (That's How They Do It In Hawaii)  When I Was In Hawaii, They Never Threw Away The Core, They Always Used It For Something.  Sometimes, They Even Grilled It, Although I've Never Tried That.  But, I Know They Did It With Honey and Some Kind of Teriyaki  People Have Also Left Chunks of Pineapple on the Husk and Grilled it Meat Side Down on the Grill.  Then, They Eat The Chunks of Grilled Pineapple and Use The Husks Like a Little Bowl..  You Don't Grill The Husk Part.  You Can Also Keep The Husk Whole, Like a Bowl and Take the Center Core Out, Then Fill It Full Of Fruit Salad or Use it as a Drink Container or Dessert Container.<br /><br />Someone Told Me They Like To Make Pineapple Greek Yogurt and Fill It, Then Freeze It a Short Time.  I've Never Tried That.  I've Made Pineapple Cheesecake and That's Delicious, but I Know It's Tricky Working With Pineapple Sometimes.  You Know, If You've Ever Tried to Make Jello & Put Pineapple In.  YIKES!!! The Bromelain in the Pineapple Keeps Your Gelatin From Setting.  It is a Great Anti-Inflammatory & Helps Your Digestive Tract & Tummy Feel Better, But That Same Enzyme Interferes with Your Jello Setting Up.<br /><br />When Washing These, Be Extra Carful and Wash Them Separate.  I Use Tooth Picks, to Get the Pineapple Out That Gets Stuck In The Little Crevices.  I Always Put The Parts Back Into The Box & Make Sure Everything is Dry.  So, That's It.

The lining inside is black and white striped, which I thought was a bit interesting, but it grew on me pretty quickly. The edges of the wallet aren't at all rough and the seams are all well done.<br /><br />This wallet has plenty of room to hold everything I need to put in it. I also really like having two spots for for cash or papers in the back. I like being able to keep my cash separate from anything else and that isn't possible with some wallets.

The shipping was unbelievably fast.,"I ordered this to wear at a Con in Atlanta and was worried it was going to be too hot to wear.  I was expecting the fabric to be thick and stiff.  It's actually very comfortable and breathable.  It's a mix between cotton and linen much like the shirts I wear in the Florida heat so I don't expect to have to worry about heat exhaustion even though it's long sleeved.  I will update after the Con on how well it performs.  The fit is a bit looser than I expected but that's actually a good thing in my case.  I have a 48&#34; chest and ordered the X-Large according to the size chart.  I was expecting the shirt to come out a bit small for me as I am very overweight and my gut definitely exceeds my chest size.  The shirt is actually a little loose on me.  The sleeves were too long for me but that's normal for me.  When you have to order larger sizes because you are overweight, the arm length increases as well.  If you have this same problem, you can re-sew the button for the cuff to make the cuff size smaller.  That will make the cuff stop when it touches the top of your hand instead of hanging down over your hand.  I almost forgot:  They shipped amazingly fast.

This film manages to do just that. Or does it? Revolving around the timeless and satisfying dynamic of the &#34;revenge tale&#34;, the movie runs in a fairly predictable pattern. The real character, and the real appeal of the film comes through in some spectacular cinemetography and visual effects. Detail has never been so looked after. From the costumes to the weapons to the set design, one never feels incomplete immersion. Casting was a pleasant surprise here. Mikkelsen plays his lead in the same sincere and intense manner that he always does. And there in may lie the secret here. The entire film smacks of a quiet desperation and some grim certainties that underscore frontier life in the western territories. All in all, there is little to detract from the action, save for the tired and ever staling idea that fossil fuel is the downfall of civilization. See There Will be Blood, etc. All in all, the film was well acted and nicely shot. Definitely worth a look, and must have on Blu-Ray or other HD format.",31-08-2015,1

He was caught between that proverbial rock  and  a hard place and was forced to make an impossibly tough choice.

At least until the chapter when the body is discovered.  Then the author seemed to loose focus.  Sam's character suddenly reveled she has mob connections and we are introduced to a group of people called the Mom Squad.  They somehow play a role in solving the mystery  You are also introduced to Nick's crazy aunt which sets up the second book.<br /><br />In the second book the crazy aunt has a voodoo curse go wrong and everybody including the Sherriff is running around trying to undo the curse with more magic.  Which by the way the author insists on misspelling.  Some part of the story are humorous but it would have benefited from a good editor.  Sam's character expresses interest in learning magic (my spelling not theirs) in this book.<br /><br />Now we hit the third book in which we again find Sam's Mom squad and now we find out that Sam is related to Santa Claus and the Grams character is dating father time.  We also see the return of Magic in the form of the queen of the witches.  So if Sam wanted to learn more about magic why didn't she just go to this witch she already knows?<br /><br />The authors seem to be addicted the unbelievable plot twist school of writing.  They also like to change voices pretty much every chapter from Nick to Sam unless they don't.  Kind of like the book I couldn't really find a pattern.  They started out with a good premise and then seemed to say &#34;Oh well lets write this half stoned&#34;.<br /><br />Truthfully I would have given it two stars but, knowing what is involved in writing a book and given the fact it did hold my attention if only to find out what whacked out thing they would introduce next I gave it three.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good mystery this isn't it.  If you are looking for a book that will keep you guessing if only as to what or who they will introduce next this would be a good choice.

Lewis’ ethical dilemma about his counter-transference experience was also very interesting and how he dealt with his struggle and guilt. But I also felt it was more than average counter-transference expereince as Lewis had a powerful crush on Lewis from his high school days. I really liked the way Josephine tactfully created Lewis’ profession so noone would be too caught up that a therapist was emotionally & sexually involved with a patient….well… Lewis was still Jasper’s therapist albeit an unregistered one but at least they took 6 month away from each other and then Lewis decided to study further (which would help him to understand more about the dynamics in a therapeutic relationship)…so I felt better as a professional…<br />I also liked the way Josephine added a little sexual intimacy without overwhelming Jasper and Lewis’ emotional journey…<br /><br />Lewis’s parents were simple adorable!!! They reminded of the previous owner of my home so I kept laughing whenever I visualised them walking around naked doing chores…bending around to pick up things…putting the baking tray into the oven…sitting around…hahahhaaaaa<br /><br />There were no perfect bodies with stunning features in this book , how refreshing is that! Jasper and Lewis were just everyday individuals dealing with life and desperately trying to resolve their personal issues.<br /><br />I think, Josephine wrote this story with a wonderful level of sensitiveness and empathy.

It's not easy to fit so much story, background, personality, passion and love in so few pages.  Not only does Ms. Summers accomplish this, but she does so in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Erin McDonald is getting through each day by putting on a happy face and acting as if she is suffering from a broken heart.  For the love of god, 8 years has gone by. Is it going to stop hurting when she thinks of Jesse and how he left her behind?  Probably not, especially now that he's back in town for a visit.  Her body and heart seems to have forgotten that he's bad news and leads to nothing, but pain.<br /><br />Jesse Hackett has never regretted his decision to leave behind the country life for a successful career in the city.  But, he's always been haunted by the loss of the love of his life.  He's back in town for his mom's birthday and he wants nothing more than to rekindle the old flame.  How to do that without breaking both of their hearts even more is the big question.  He is only visiting and will be going back to his life in the city and he knows Erin would never follow him.<br /><br />This book is not short on heat and passion, that's for sure.  The witty banter between Erin and her sister made me laugh out loud in more than one spot.  Eden really is very good at sarcastic humor, which just happens to be my first language.  The love between Jesse and Erin was bittersweet, yet fun to read.  I highly recommend this book and any other Eden Summers story.

Shirley Jones was an actress that I admired from afar, until I read about her choices in life.  To begin, the book isn't well-written.  Jones frequently repeats herself, her sentence structure lacks clarity, and her use of personal pronouns is at times confusing.  I could, however, forgive these distractions; after all, she's an actress and singer, not a writer.  But she should have made use of a good editor or ghost writer.  That said, what I found most unappealing were her vivid descriptions of her sexual mores and lascivious forays with Jack Cassidy, including a 3-way event.  Not only does she make clear that Mister Cassidy was \\""very well-endowed,\\"" but she also tells us that his son was even bigger.  Cassidy, as everyone knew, was an unrelenting cheat and adulterer.  But this didn't seem to bother Jones much.  At least, not enough to stop loving him or to leave him for many years.  The Jones-Cassidy family were dysfunction because, it seems, that neither Jones nor Cassidy did what caring parents are supposed to do.  Near the end of the book, Jones repeatedly attempts to justify her marriage to Marty Ingels-as she has been doing for more than 30 years.  Jones claims she loved Cassidy (and still does), and that she loves Ingels.  Both men, as she describes them, have serious flaws that she excuses and forgives out of hand.  Unfortunately, she isn't a very sophisticated women, coming from a small town in Pennsylvania.  I know that \\""Tell All\\"" autobiographies sell books, but I think Jones discredits herself in this missive.  An example of this is, at the end of the book, she proudly boasts (in some detail) of still masturbating regularly at 80 years of age.  As Miss Jones warns the reader early in her book, she is not the quaint, innocent young lady she flawlessly portrayed in her early films.  And that's just too bad!",09-09-2013,1

She has the world at her fingertips and little does she know it, men within arms reach. She may have been fed by the silver spoon, but it wasn't always skittles rainbows and fluffy unicorns. Nope! Life has been anything but wonderful for Nora. Basically she was thrown to the wolves....and by wolves I mean her wonderful family. They are wolves in sheep's clothing. Other than the wolves, I was completely intrigued with Nora's approach on life. She is ready to let go of the good girl persona, and step into the world of carelessness, fun, partying, and God knows what else. She may walk on the wild side, but sometimes life throws you a gazillion curve balls when you least expect it to....enter Leo Tate, Baby!<br /><br />Dear goodness, Leo had me wrapped around his pinky finger the moment he waltzed into my life.

He literally will boogie woogie his way into your heart. As much as he is kind and beautiful, he is totally off limits to any woman under the age 25....but little does he know, his world is gonna tilt on its axis when Nora Blakely, not so graciously, enters his life.<br /><br />I need more Sebastian's and Mila's in my life.

The author starts out the book telling you exactly what you're going to get. Backstory.<br /><br />You get the backstory for the main characters in a multi-book BDSM series (the Rescue Me series). There's not much sex in this book at all. A couple of steamy scenes that are tame from a BDSM point of view and one scene that is graphic that shows one of the characters forced into sexual slavery (so it's not at all sexy).<br /><br />That said, this book is fantastically written. The characters are amazing. I loved them all. The depth they show, the real, authentic feelings, and their actions all drew me in.

Then yesterday it started making a different noise than it usually makes -- it sounded like a pump was frozen up - and there was a burning smell.  And it again developed a leak in the bottom.

The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on, but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.

I could have purchased the part from several suppliers ranging in price from $4.86 to $9 and most charged a little more for shipping. This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart, that is, the hard, black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times, rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum, it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off, you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it, counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement.",31-08-2015,1

White Top Load Washer,Major Appliances,5,5,5,N,N,Here's to an EMPTY laundry room!,"I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.",31-08-2015,1

The underneath storage drawers came with this set and I feel that I receive a great deal.  As far as performance, so far amazing!  With a large household, I believe we have cut our time in half at least for washing and drying and the cloths look and smell clean.  The units are very quiet; our laundry room is next to the kitchen, next to open den and you cannot hear them during operation.  At first we did have a rocking motion from the washer; however, we failed (at first) to level with a level and very important on the feet of the washer and dryer is to adjust the feet, level and use the locking bolt on each foot.  Once we leveled the machines and used the locking bolt to lock each foot in place, we had no additional rocking problems from the washer.  We are following all of the operation procedures for the machines, if you have not owned a front loader before there are a few additional maintenance/clean out producers one must incorporate in bi-weekly and monthly routines, but other than this they work as expected and above.  I hope this continues for many years and maintenance and breakdowns do not plague us as I have read about on a few reviews.  My two sets before this LG Pair was Roper sets and they each lasted over 10 years each with few easy maintenance problems (a couple of replaced heating elements on the dryer; very simple to perform on a Ropers).  It may be unrealistic, however, I do hope to come close to 10 years of few maintenance problems with these LG's also (I realize there are more parts, digital, etc).  They look and feel quality made.

Long Review/ Story.,"Where do I begin? I received my brand new lil washer machine today. Couldn’t be more excited to do laundry! After 12 years of schlepping to the laundry mat, dodging cars to cross the street, counting pennies to convert to quarters,  I finally invested in my own private washing machine. I have to admit, this is my 3rd attempt at buying a portable washing machine in the last month. One of the main reasons why I made a decision to make this type of purchase is that the laundry-mat disgusts me. After 10+ years of going to the Ol coin op, I finally had it. I did a load of wash, and when it was done, I took my clothes out and everything was covered in Dog/ Cat hair. EVERYTHING was covered. IM highly allergic to dogs and cats and thankfully the laundry manager was there when this happened. She gave me quarters to re-wash my clothes. Unfortunately, the second wash didn’t get all the hairs out, so after drying, I took a lint brush to every article of clothing, to try and get what pet hair was left. It was a complete nightmare! And so from that, I went on Amazon, read a million and 1 reviews and bought the Wonder Washer.  WHAT a JOKE! Then I made a second purchase for the E-clean… NOT fun either. SO, after more research and more re-reading of all those millions of reviews on every single portable washer unit on Amazon, I made the brave decision, took a leap of faith, and got The Laundry Alternative Super Compact 5.5 lb capacity. Ill be honest, I was really trying to save money with the other 2 previous purchases, but what I got was a huge headache, ruined clothes, broken machines, time lost, lint monsters, and sprained wrist from wringing clothes (not really, but you get my drift). In the long run, many months from now, maybe even years, that this Laundry Alternative Super Compact will eventually pay for itself.  So my review, to be fair was going to be a 1 star, maybe 2 stars. The machine I received came poorly packaged and the unit had a crack on the inside motor area. It still leaks from the body, but that’s due to it being cracked and from it being poorly made/ assembled. Here’s is a brief rundown of my first impressions: -Received item in a non-secured box. The bottom of the box was taped on, and was not part of the box. -When opened, broken pieces of foam came out of the box and were all broken inside the washer where the motor and wires are. I carefully vacuumed the inside to gather as much of the broken pieces of foam. -I thoroughly inspected the unit, and found 1 major crack on the motor cover, and the front of the unit being unevenly put together. -The exterior outside unit was dirty, with dirt marks around it. -When lifted and carried to kitchen to hook it up, there were swishing sounds of water. -Major water leaks from base and side exterior. No water leaks from hose/ faucet hookup. -A random black plastic block fell from the inside. I have no idea what’s it for. It had grease on it.  AND here is my simple comparison bullets: Laundry Mat: Pros: -Get multiple loads of wash done  Cons: -Dollars and Quarters…. -Other people’s clothes you don’t know being washed in that very same washer you just washed your clothes in. Do you really think your clothes are being cleaned? -Time consuming -Cant really leave to tend to other errands, or do other things. You spend roughly 2+ hours at the laundry mat, not including fold time.  The Laundry Alternative: Pros: -Don’t have to go to laundry mat -NO more scrounging for quarters! -You can stay home and search Amazon for more cool apartment gadgets to buy to make your life easier. -Pretty quiet. -Once you get the hang of it, no babysitting! It’s all automatic and really does get your clothes clean -Pretty Compact and doesn’t take a lot of room. I have a very narrow small kitchen, so for me, IM going to need to store it someplace else. -It’s a wash, rinse, spin cycle! -NO SMELL! The WW and e-clean had this toxic smell to it, this didn’t. That was my fear, as I’m highly sensitive to chemical smells and IM very happy to report, no toxic smell (at least mine didn’t). -Fast Delivery, was delivered by USPS on a Sunday! Ordered on a Friday :)  Cons: -Very Flimsy gooseneck holder. Kept coming off the draining hose and wouldn’t stay put when water would drain. WATER went everywhere. I had to manually hold it in the sink every time the rinse cycle went. Eventually, after the 3rd wash, I took one side of the gooseneck holder and attached it to the black water hose (the one from faucet to laundry unit) and this kept the draining hose to stay in the sink (NO more babysitting ) -35 lbs is not too heavy, but not light enough (actually more annoying) to store and bring back to kitchen. Needs caster wheels that lock in place when using washer. -Only able to use cold water via the hose attachment. IM sure you could get a different hose that's suitable for any temperature, but that should have been done by the manufacture. -No gentle cycle -Pretty much everything is plastic made. The inside washing area is stainless steel. The agitator is plastic. -It will literally take you all day to do your laundry, as it’s very small and can only wash roughly 5.5lbs of clothes. So best used for daily, every other day light wash. (took me 5 hours to do 4 loads with clean up, hang drying, troubleshooting etc, those 4 loads would of been 1 load at the laundry mat) - The power cord is slightly too short. Needs about an extra 12 inches to it.  The initial leaking caused a major mini flood on my kitchen floors. The gooseneck hose holder is very flimsy and didn’t hold the hose properly onto the sink. When the rinse cycle started, the drain hose started doing the cobra dance and the drain water went all over everywhere. It was the first time for me to use this machine, so getting to know it was not friendly.  The washing portion of it was great. Very little to no lint left on the clothing after wash. Spin cycle does a great job, makes hang drying fasterand NO wringing of the clothes to get excess water! Even with the cracked motor and water leaking from the sides, I was able to wash 4 loads to test it out. With the first two loads, when the rinse cycle finished, dead small flies and foam particles came out. The second load, it was more just foam particles. The other two loads were to re-wash some of the towels I washed in the 1st & 2nd load, since the first load leaked and spewed water all over the floor that caused a mini flood. My kitchen rug was soaked, not only did I use towels, but went through an entire roll of paper towels. Water was everywhere. The only good thing that came out of that was my floor had an unexpected cleaning.  The good news is, that mini flood was not from the assembly of the actual unit, that flood was from the drain hose. After the 2nd wash, I was pretty familiar with how to navigate this bad boy, and by the 4th wash, I was sitting on my couch for 30 minutes while that load washed.  The unit still leaks water from the bottom (probably not safe because of the wiring and plug, and from the top/sides. IM not going to use the machine again, until I get a new one.  Overall, even with the broken machine, IM REALLY impressed with how well the machine handles clothes. IM impressed with the high quality faucet/hose attachment (I say this, because of the E-clean experience I had, you had to hold the cheaply made hose onto the sink while water filled the wash). No leaks from my sink faucet, no leaks to the washing unit (ALTHOUGH, when detaching water hose from washing unit, it will leak, so make sure you have a towel handy). I also love that the front right leg is an actual rotating wheel, which adjust to level with floor. It keeps the unit from shaking in spin cycle. -Once you understand and troubleshoot the trial and errors of the machine, you will not need to sit and babysit. The first 3 loads I did, water went everywhere, and I literally had a flood!  I do believe I need a new unit, one that issecurely packed carefully  and assembled properly so it doesn’t leak. I'll probably update this review once i get a new machine. My apologies, as this review has turned into a story. Right now its at 3 stars, almost 4 as I really love this machine now. But until a new one comes into my life, it will stay at a 3.  *update* Impeccable customer service! 4 stars for that. This really is a wonderful little washer and even though it says cold water only, you can use Warm Water to get a deeper clean.",31-08-2015,1

It would make a nice inexpensive gift for any child for their room.<br /><br />1. RoHS, CE certified<br /><br />2. This is made of heavy plastic and has a 5 inch diameter and is 5 1/8th inches tall, it has a clear dome and colored LED lights shoot from the dome in addition to a ring of LED lights around the bottom which in combination create a two dimensional light show.<br /><br />3. The bottom is made with 2 indented screw holes and an indentation for the cord so it is easy to hang on the wall or ceiling, or just plug it in and set it on a stand.<br /><br />4. There are a total of 51 LED lights in Red, Green and Blue that rotate and fill the room with lights, for its price and size this is a very nice little light with a big light show that my Grandchildren love.<br /><br />5. There is also automated sound activation that changes the light show to match the music or at my house the songs my grandchildren sing to get the lights to speed up and change. This sound activation is not as sensitive as some lights I have tried and doesn’t pick up every nuance however it is a wonderful feature and I love hearing my three year old singing. The giggling and laughing Priceless.<br /><br />6. There are two things that I would change on this, the cord is only 35 inches long and there is no on/off switch or sound activation switch.

I discovered Zuke's Skinny Bakes while searching for vegan dog treats. The flavor that I purchased was Pumpkin, and I like the ingredients for the most part. The ingredients are as follows: Oatmeal, Pearled Barley, Rice Bran, Pumpkin, Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Potatoes, Pea Fiber, Cane Molasses, Oil Blend [Canola oil, Sunflower oil, Olive oil], Natural Flavor, Rosemary Extract and Mixed Tocopherols [a preservative]. I appreciate that there is no added wheat, corn, soy, salt, or dyes in these treats, and that they are made in the USA. I paid $5.99 for a 12oz. bag which supposedly contains 140+ treats, so in my opinion, this is a good deal. I believe my dog would rate the taste of these as a 2/5,  when he's given a choice between these treats and treats containing meat, he always eats the other treats first. Even though they're definitely not his favorite, he still does eat them eventually. Since the texture is so dry, dipping them in water might make them a little bit more appealing. The biscuits do smell good, and I tried one to see what they taste like. In my opinion they're not great, but they're not bad either, predominantly bland flavor with a little bit of sweetness. I wouldn't eat them as a snack. The size of the biscuits is fine for my medium sized dog, and if you're feeding a smaller dog the biscuit breaks in half easily, so the treats shouldn't be too big for tiny breeds to enjoy.Mixed Tocopherols [a preservative].

I paid $5.99 for a 12oz. bag which supposedly contains 140+ treats, so in my opinion, this is a good deal. My dog thinks they taste okay, however when he's given a choice between these treats and treats containing meat, he always eats the other treats first. Even though they're definitely not his favorite, he still does eat them eventually and I feel much better feeding him Zuke's Skinny Bakes versus Purina Beggin' Strips or Pup-Peroni. The biscuits do smell good, and I tried one to see what they taste like. In my opinion they're not great, but they're not bad either, predominantly bland flavor with a little bit of sweetness from the pumpkin, sweet potato and molasses. I wouldn't eat them as a snack or anything. The size of the biscuits is fine for my medium sized dog, and if you're feeding a smaller dog the biscuit breaks in half easily, so the treats shouldn't be too big for tiny breeds to enjoy. If you don't care about Zuke's association with Nestlé / Purina, I still recommend these, as the ingredients are better than most mainstream dog treats. However, I will be searching for a new brand.",31-08-2015,1

I read the other reviews and agree it is too tall for my 10 gallon tank to be able to use holding it straight up. You would have to keep it on a slant, but that wasn't working for me. Instead I did not use the extender tube. I removed that completely, both parts and put the gravel vacuum part on the end directly. Since it doesn't lock in that way, I took a small rubber band and looped it around one of the slots on the gravel vacuum piece and up over the elbow piece. Worked perfect holding it straight up that way!!! I also use a small rubber band to hold the filter bag on, just in case it falls off in the tank. I've read the reviews on the filter bag getting pretty grungy. Honestly if you end up needing a replacement you can use a thin material baby sock because the actual filter bag resembles one itself. I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase so far.",31-08-2015,1

(It was basically a sterilite bin with a hole cut into the top.) My old litter box worked great at stopping litter trackage and spillage, but its enclosed nature allowed my young male to trap my old female inside, and it has begun to stress her significantly. (He likes to play--she does not.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Two Meows just didn't live up to my expectations, based off of product descriptions and reviews. I bought it as well as a little catching mat by the same company; despite rave reviews saying it trapped litter marvelously, my living room was still coated in a near-constant sheen of gravel. I had to sweep daily just to try and keep it under control. (Oh, and my cats managed to tear a split into the mat about 1/3rd its total length.)<br /><br />Ultimately, I switched to pellet litter instead of clay litter, which has fixed the tracking issue, but the whole point of the Two Meows was to be able to use clumping litter without all the tracking.<br /><br />So here's where I try to give credit where credit is due:<br /><br />The Two Meows is probably the best open-pan box I've seen in terms of litter spillage. Take that however you will.<br /><br />My male is pretty rambunctious. (He will even playcin the litter.) I think we might have had better success with keeping the litter in the pan if it was just my lackadaisical female using it. If your cat is old or very calm, this box might work better for you than it did for me. I don't recommend it to anyone with very hyperactive cats, because the walls and grate just won't be enough.<br /><br />I live in a small apartment, so a little litter tracking goes a long way. If you have a large home or a &#34;cat room&#34; the amount of spillage I experienced might be comparatively insignificant.<br /><br />I wouldn't actively discourage anyone from buying this box, but be aware that, depending on you, your home, and your cats, it just might not live up to the reviews.",31-08-2015,1

I wasn't sure how handy it would be for me, but then the day it arrived, I tried it on and happened to also get some furniture (a cat tree) that had a ton of little screws to put it together.  I placed the screws in the wrist band pocket so I wouldn't loose them and proceeded to build the furniture in absolute comfort.  It was a 90 degree day, hot as heck, and I kept sweating with no AC in the house.  This wrist band was perfect for wiping my brow and keeping my small parts corralled as I built.  I cheered DG Sports as I used it.<br /><br />Then, later, I have taken it walking, jogging, and horseback riding and absolutely love it.  The only improvement would be that I really think they should package these in pairs. I need to order a second one right away so I have two.

It also shows up fairly well so I wouldn't use it on anything that you don't want it to show it has been patched.  I would recommend when using this on or close to the edge of what you are repairing to make sure you place enough of the patch over the edge to minimize the patch curling up. I used it on the side of my car seat and found that getting in and out of my car pulled the edges up slightly and colored them blue from rubbing my jeans. This was very noticeable since my seats are tan. I did also find that parts of the patch came up from the heat of my car initially. After trying to push it back in place a few times it did eventually adhere a little better after a day or two.

I've been playing it for at least an hour straight. There is a section that shows you how to play the game. I have not been asked repeatedly to rate the game. It plays really good on my Kindle Fire HD (2012) tablet.<br /><br />There are two things that I would like to point out that could possibly annoy some people: The first thing is when starting the game for the first time a screen pops up with different offers. You can close the window and you are not bothered in between games. After playing the game for some time, that window of offers has not reappeared when first opening the app. The second thing is the layout of the puzzle. The letters of some words at the end of a row are sometimes carried over to the beginning of a new row. This can lead to confusion as to whether the letters are a continuation from the previous row or the start of a new word. So far, I've been able to figure it out pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I still enjoy the game a lot, and I believe others will too.",31-08-2015,1

This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn’t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven’t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don’t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn’t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don’t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that.  5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

You need to download from a major brand like Asus to acquire the driver I would google BCM94352HMB driver and go to the Wikidevi site and download the Wi-Fi Driver V6.32.223.1 for Windows 7 32bit & 64bit. Its an Asus driver and it works alot better than the Dell driver which I got connections drops with.

The range and speed was acceptable, although, for the price I would have liked better. This would probably have been a 3 or 4 star review except, as of mid July, 2015, it has stopped working properly. One day, out of the blue, it no longer provided an internet connection. The wireless network still exists but all devices attached show no internet connection. The same happens for any devices connected via Ethernet through the router. I have tried all the following in troubleshooting:<br />1: connected straight to the modem and had an internet connection.<br />2: Reset to factory settings and connected to default network but no internet.<br />3: Connected replacement router via same ethernet cable to the modem and it provided internet without issue.<br />4: checked router, power adapter, and Ethernet cable for any signs of damage (we have a cat) but none exist.<br /><br />So, As a result, I am rather upset that this product did not even last 2 years. I paid $135 for this thing new. It I had wanted a disposable product i would have spent 30 bucks on a cheap wireless N router and called it a day.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a fix or something for this issue, I will try it and gladly take this up to 3 or so stars but for the time being, I really believe it deserves one star.",31-08-2015,1

Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process.",31-08-2015,1

I live in a 2 bed 1 bath apartment with my girlfriend, and our two Siberian Huskies, and another couple. Needless to say, we are all packed in there like sardines! Now, let's be honest here... 50% of the space is for the other couple, 60% of the space is for the pups, and the other 30% is my girlfriends. The numbers don't lie... we definitely have no more space at this point! I bought this for me, in hopes that I can re-claim a percentage of space for myself. Bed risers just weren't going to do the trick, and wooden framed with built-in drawers are much out of my price range. For me, this was a solid meet-me-in-the-middle solution.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS:<br />The actual storage space of each of the two &#34;cavities&#34; from floor to the under-bars measures at about 12-1/2&#34;tall x 30&#34;wide x 60&#34;deep. I've very pleased to say that I was able to fit EIGHT (count em'), EIGHT large 12&#34; storage tubs under the bed! The tubs were about 8 bucks each at our local &#34;w-mart&#34;. We have gotten rid of the box spring completely, without any issues so far, and we feel no difference in comfort without it. Our mattress is an old 8&#34; coil spring with a separate 3&#34; memory foam mattress topper on the mattress. I could see how some may say a solid 8&#34; memory foam mattress might sag through the spaces. Some have put down cardboard for that, but I didn't find it necessary with our mattress. So far, we've been sleeping on this bed for a few weeks and it seems very solid, give or take a husky and some horseplay. It's very quiet, and I have not hears and creeks or squeaks from the frame as of yet.<br /><br />My worries were put aside when we finally received it in the mail. I was reading others reviews and was initially concerned about the frame arriving damaged during shipping as others have stated. Although, the box did arrive with a few minor bumps and bruises, there was zero damage and no rust to actual frame. I LOVE that this frame folds up, that's a really nice convenience. It took me all of 20 minutes to un-box and setup this frame where the old one used to be. There was very little assembly that I actually had to do. I was surprised that I did not need any tools what-so-ever. The only thing that confused me for a moment was the brackets that lock the outer legs in place. Those needed to be rotated PRIOR to fully folding out the legs, and then they lined up just fine. The cross-bars are not flush with the other length-wise support bars, and that is a bit of a pet peeve for me, but not that big of a deal. I'm definitely satisfied, and I would recommend this product.ctual frame. I LOVE that this frame folds up, that's a really nice convenience.

This desk was my 30th piece, and I just ordered my 31st. I call Sauder the Cadillac of Walmart. Their attention to detail is astonishing. It is par for the course to have a few pieces arrive damaged in shipping, and yes Sauder, obviously damaged in the factory BEFORE packaging. But Sauder makes it right (usually, see below). Just hop on their website and order the replacement pieces you need, free of charge. Set aside the project for a week. My parts' orders arrive within a week.<br /><br />This particular desk is intricately designed and looks fabulous. It took more time than usual. It is a solid, well-designed desk which has a lot of pieces. It astounds me to see people criticize Sauder for furniture that does not come out well -- it is THEMSELVES who are the poor assemblers! I have assembled three or four other companies' furniture, and all fared poorly, and we were careful and conscientious.<br /><br />The Carson Forge collection is a family's dream furniture. When I get a knick in it, I take a black magic marker to it, then fast smudge the black using Kleenex. That is all you do to make an imperfection disappear, presto chango. Plus, before assembly, take Carson Forge pieces and with a magic marker, blacken all the edges, smudging with Kleenex.<br /><br />Sauder is now middle-class furniture. It is what people can afford. Sauder, for the most part, cares about its customers. Only one time did I have a bad experience -- for an armoire, more than six pieces came damaged. Sauder balks when the number of pieces to send out free is over their quota. A customer service rep \\""Tanya\\"" contacted me saying that she felt, in couched terminology, that I was lying about how many pieces arrived to me damaged (number of replacement pieces), and that I had to send them photos. I told her no (and in no uncertain terms, that she could shove it). She did not like that and threw it back in my face, refusing to send replacements, more than willing to let a several hundred dollar unassembled armoire ([[ASIN:B001DKTKDO Sauder Harbor View Armoire - Antiqued White]]) rot in my hallway. My husband intervened, complied, and emailed pictures. It was humiliating and degrading -- overall a bad experience. But that was unusual. I hope to not have a repeat of that. If it happens again, I will be contacting their Chairman of the Board and President, and scream bloody murder. It may be that people abuse their free replacement service, but why the heck does Sauder not take note when I contact them that I had (at the time) over 25 pieces of their furniture in my home, and I am not a crank. Jeez and criminy!<br /><br />Take a trip to any furniture store. Bring a flashlight. Go up to a wall unit, open a cabinet, tap on side walls, bottoms of drawers, very top of the unit. Much of the woods there are 1/4\\"" thick. And for the 9X less, you can buy Sauder, and to tell you the truth, Sauder looks just as nice, and you won't go broke. What costs $5,000 at a furniture store could only be $500 buying Sauder. Price out wall units, and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />Anyway, Sauder is a super company, most of the time.al hundred dollar unassembled armoire ([[ASIN:B001DKTKDO Sauder Harbor View Armoire - Antiqued White]]) rot in my hallway.

So save your money and headache and buy something else.  Trust me, I hate to give bad reviews, but this is a sound equipment that you should skip!",31-08-2015,1

New design Backup External Battery Pack and Charger (Power Bank) with flashlight,Mobile_Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,A Very Good Flashlight & Lightweight Charger,"I bought this primarily to be used as a flashlight and it has worked out well over the last five weeks. I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple.",31-08-2015,1

In most cases, we get what we expect.  I was skeptical in purchasing these and saw mixed reviews, but these guys claim to be &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; and are &#34;genuine&#34;.  Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.  The worst part now, is that I have passed the one month window to return these because once back from my trip, I've had to deal with some work emergencies.  So I've basically just wasted my hard earned money on garbage, with no more option for refund.",30-08-2015,1

But I have such straight hair without any real body so the beachy look just isn't a good look for me, unlike in my younger years when I loosely permed my hair and my hair would look great at the beach even after swimming in the ocean half the day.

I've tried tons of products promising new skin and heels so fancy, you'll never want to wear shoes, again. Nothing worked. My heels are probably typical of most women who go to the gym, wear sandals all summer, and wear those &#34;cute&#34; shoes that kill us. I use the Pedi Egg and various &#34;sanders&#34; from Beauty Brands each time I shower. Though the simple things like homemade foot scrubs, sanding, and lotion can help, nothing, and I mean nothing, worked like this product! After weeks and weeks of researching and humming and hawing, it went on sale and I bought it. Here's my tip to success: Soak feet. Take a nice long bath. I used bubbles, made myself some nice tea, brought in my iPad and watched about 40 minutes of TV to pass the time. (I hate baths. This part was the hardest for me.) Then I dried my feet a little, and while still prune toed from the bath, slipped the pre-gel booties on and put on a pair of my husband's socks over them to help keep them in place. I left mine on for 90 mins (suggested by a blogger) and then rinsed them off. My feet had a sheen to them and smelled nice but that was it. A watched foot does not peel. Day 2: Soaked just my feet in a foot bath for 30 mins. Nothing exciting but my feet felt relaxed from the hot water. Day 3: Whoa. My big toe, previously callused, peeled a little. I couldn't help but pick a tiny bit to reveal all this new skin under what felt like a giant mound of dead skin. Day 4: The sides of my feet started to peel some along with my heels a tiny bit. I continued to soak daily from 20-45 mins. I also have been wearing socks and sneakers all week. I've also sent out texts to multiple friends who were disgusted. Day 5: The magic starts to happen! More peeling...even around my toenails where I thought nothing bad was happening. Apparently, dry dead skin resided there, too. Right now I'm on Day 8: The majority of the peeling is over. I have been taking daily foot soaks/baths, using a washcloth to rub off dead skin during the foot bath, and today I peeled a little by hand because I couldn't help myself. Not much more peeling is happening. There's a few bits here and there but as I lay in bed, rubbing my once sandpaper feeling feet together, images of silk feet pop in my head. They feel so nice and the cracks and calluses are gone! I'll probably shed another day or two and be done with it.

Some of the lighter colors (i.e., gold) don't show up super well on pale skin, especially if you are also wearing a shimmery eyeshadow.  So keep that in mind.  (The gold would look awesome on darker skin without shadow, and I can make it work without shadow on my pale skin, as well.)<br /><br />These last all day under any one (or more) of the following conditions:<br /><br />(1) If you don't have oily eyelids<br />(2) If you use a setting powder or finishing powder (like the translucent one from e.l.f.)<br />(3) If you wear them over primer and powder eyeshadow<br /><br />If you have oily eyelids and don't do #2 or #3 above, this will migrate (trust me -- been there, done that).<br /><br />I wear contact lenses and have somewhat sensitive eyes but these do not give me any trouble, which is great.

It IS matte, it dries somewhat quickly, but ends up being quite thick on. The color is very chic, although it's a little different than the photo, I'd say less muted/less burgundy. It's a good buy. Just not the highest quality, because of the patchiness.<br /><br />[edit] I was writing this review for the color Backstage, but I see the colors are kind of all mashed into one listing.<br /><br />The color Stunner is another one I have -- and the only thing I have to say about is that if you think it's &#34;too purple,&#34; go ahead and spend five bucks on it.

Even with black-out curtains I have trouble falling asleep. One thing I've noticed that really helps are sleeping masks. With that being said, I've tried quite a few and I haven't found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear. This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I've ever worn to bed. I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality- which is why I'm rating it 5 stars.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness. No light is going to get through this mask! It seems a little bulky at first- especially if you're used to the thin silk masks that are commonly sold. With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you'll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through. It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really nice.<br /><br />The mask fit my head perfectly. I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone. The mask can be adjusted with little sliding adjusters and then has a clasp in the back that secures the mask around your head. The company boasts that the clasp won't snag in hair- and I have very snaggly fine hair. So far it hasn't gotten tangled in my hair, although sometimes I do accidently clasp a few strands of hair into the clip and it pulls them out when I roll around. I just put my hair in a low pony tail to avoid that problem.<br /><br />One thing that I really love about this mask is that it's contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose. Most sleeping masks don't adequate fit around your nose so have small gaps where light can get through. That is not the case with this mask. Because it fits snug around all of the curves of your face- literally no light gets through. That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask. I have a Jewish nose (a big nose) and it fits well over it.<br /><br />Overall, I do really like this mask. The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that's my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it's a great product. Very quality sewn and made with good materials. It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face. I'd definitely recommend this mask for anyone looking for a sleep aid. It'd make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.

Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working.

Just know that this stand doesn't &#34;Lock In&#34; your PS4 and while it firmly supports it vertically it will not prevent an accidental overturn if you do not have it on a firm shelf.<br /><br />The dual fans make some noise but not enough to distract you over background noises. As for the USB ports, you connect a USB lead from the stand to one of the open ports on your PS4, this gives you one open port on the PS4 and 3 USB ports on the stand itself. Also if you have the PS4 settings in Rest Mode it will automatically shut down the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports.

What used to take two buttons is now a giant PITA to get done before an opponent snaps the ball or the play clock runs out.<br /><br />The turbo button is back, but the player movement is still slow and awkward.

I haven't had the chance to complete it as there is a lot of gameplay, but so far, it is a very fun game.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VII is a turn-based JRPG.  However, there is a small twist from most turned based games in that instead of moving in a set order, you have a time gauge that fills up. Once full, you can input a move.  Moves are executed in the order they are put in.  This adds a real-time element to the battles.  This game has random encounters and there are a lot of them.  Enemies can be encountered everywhere with a few exceptions like towns and cities.<br /><br />The story is very good, and is told well.  Events are somewhat unexpected and keep you wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />The controls are easy enough to use.  You can play with the keyboard or use most pc-compatible controllers.  I would recommend using a controller.  The game feels a little better with a controller, and you can tell that it was designed for one.<br /><br />Probably the weakest point of the game is its graphics.  They are terrible.  This is somewhat understandable considering the age of the game, but it is still bad even by PS1 standards.  This version has slightly improved graphics, but it's not very significant.<br /><br />Overall this is a great game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes Final Fantasy or RPGs in general.  However, at this point it might be worth waiting for the HD remake that has been announced.",31-08-2015,1

It's been months of grinding tomestones weekly from only 2 dungeons and the raid content (endgame) is either beyond extreme difficulty or sleep-mode.

His protean efforts have yielded a wide range of voluminous recordings, all expertly performed in an exciting range of styles.<br /><br />It’s not surprising, then, that he’s used his encyclopedic knowledge to also create a 5-disc offering of his own compositions, all excellent and the whole collection a listening delight. While it’s hard to briefly comment on so many CD’s, suffice it to say that the first three discs are openly minimalist in their origins and are hypnotic in their appeal, some cuts meditative while others will want to make you get up and dance (yes, I did). The range is delicious, including some engaging uses of prepared pianos, carillon, tape and organ. The fourth disc takes off in some unexpected directions, including a fascinating essay on the four elements and one of my favorites, “Repeating History,” a thrilling mash-up of fragments of classical compositions to which minimalist music is indebted, knowingly or not, and all knitted together seamlessly with Van Veen’s compositional threads. The last CD is NLXL, inspired by the aerial photography of Holland by Karel Tomei. There’s a great video (viewable on YouTube) of Van Veen and his wife, Sandra, performing it with huge projections of the photos behind them. I find this format more effective for the piece and while the Van Veens use a wide range of interesting techniques to accompany their two pianos (including ambient sounds), some themes overstay their welcome a bit for me without the visuals.<br /><br />So, a LOT of music to enjoy from a composer/performer of great passions and a lively imagination. Definitely worth exploring!",31-08-2015,1

After listening to these guys just a little it was apparent that they are way, way solid musicians who know their way around a guitar (both ends!) and are working super hard to bring us the joys and vibes of acoustic super-tones.

My six-year-old has found it very useful for falling asleep in strange places (hotel rooms especially), and we use it at home sometimes. I helps get past that too-tired-to-sleep phenomenon that can happen. The voice is slow, very gentle, British, massively soothing.

Jonathan and Charlotte´s version is a LOT BETTER than the original one. Then I checked the other songs - comparing to the originals - like Caruso and il mondo e nostro -- again, I liked this version better... This CD is one of the those you buy and play over and over and over again... all these classics... I have not checked their second CD yet, but I think this will be their very best ever...

My wife said she felt like they didn't do anything super original in hip hop and I said &#34;They did, but they did it when this album came out and everyone else has copied it.&#34;  Yet this album still stands out as an amazing record.  I find the use of kung fu film soundtracks especially refreshing.  I also enjoy how the RZA seems unconcerned as to whether or not his samples are in the same key.  And yet, it doesn't sound atonal or out of place.  The lyrics and hooks are catchy with funny moments, tragic moments, powerful moments, and it bridges the gaps in between.  This album is a masterful work of art.",31-08-2015,1
